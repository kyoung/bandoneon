# Bandoneon

Bandoneons are very expensive and currently problematic to export from
Argentina. This is unfortunate, since aside from the cost of craftspersonship,
there's very little reason for this instrument to be so costly.

To that end, this is a basic program for use on a RaspberryPI to emulate a
Bandoneon. Making full use of it requires a few things not included in this
repo:

- Sound samples: you need a full bandoneon sample library in `/waves`... there's
  a particular format you'll need, see the README in the waves folder
- A RaspberryPI
- IC2 extenders
- 72 or so push buttons
- A bandoneon frame (parts list and schematics to be included)


## DevMode

Like a good dev, this project is broken up into increment stages (check out the
roadmap.md file, which I will I am too lazy to relearn the markdown link syntax
for). This means that is operational on little more than the desktop with the
wave files and some environment config.

<Update this part when it's figured out.>
